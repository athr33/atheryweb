Hey! Athery or (amir) here, you can read more about me here https://amirhouri.athery.repl.co

AtheryWeb is a open source web browser thingy i made, i made it becuase Even in Incognito mode, your search history is saved and can be check using your internet provider. However, AtheryWeb uses advanced privacy measures to leave no trace behind. It deletes cookies, blocks trackers, stops trackers, and leaves no logs.

I found that internet privacy exist, everything was tracked no matter where you went, and I found it annoying, Although kinda useless i thought it would be great for a place on the interent where it would be almost impossible to be tracked, almost like a private island, and it seemed pretty easy to make, I call it private internet island or PII.

Just to put it out there, I have 0 plans of ever making AtheryWeb commercial, its completly just for fun, its mostly just a example of my skills, and just to make sure, it is not 100% made by me either. I made the UI, DuckDuckGO and google integration, about atheryweb website, the in browser virtual machine (that kinda works) and the cookie purging and automated data deletion making sure no trace is left behind, however, the VPN and Proxies where NOT made by me, im using the Ultraviolet network.

In summary, i was just testing out my skills and i kinda made something cool, if your intrested in my skills or want to contact me my email is amir.houri.contact@gmail.com
